# CircleCI 2.1 configuration file for the simple-di project.
# This pipeline will automatically build and test the library on every commit.
# It uses a modern Node.js environment and caches dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.

version: 2.1

jobs:
  build_and_test:
    # A Docker image with Node.js pre-installed. Using a specific version
    # ensures a consistent and reproducible build environment.
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:18.16.0

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code from the repository.
      - checkout

      # Step 2: Restore the npm dependencies cache.
      # This cache key is based on the contents of package-lock.json.
      # If package-lock.json changes, the cache is invalidated and a new one is created.
      - restore_cache:
          key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}

      # Step 3: Install dependencies.
      # 'npm ci' is used instead of 'npm install' as it's designed for CI environments,
      # performing a clean install and ensuring dependencies match package-lock.json.
      - run:
          name: Install Dependencies
          command: npm ci

      # Step 4: Save the newly installed dependencies to the cache.
      - save_cache:
          key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
          paths:
            - node_modules

      # Step 5: Run the build script to transpile the code.
      # This step ensures that the distributable files are correctly generated.
      - run:
          name: Build Project
          command: npm run build

      # Step 6: Run the tests to verify the library's functionality.
      # This command executes the simple test file created earlier.
      - run:
          name: Run Tests
          command: npm run test
